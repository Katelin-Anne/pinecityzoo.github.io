<h3>TIGER</h3>
<p>The tiger (<i>Panthera tigris</i>) is the largest member of the cat family and is native to Asia. 
It is instantly recognizable by its orange coat patterned with black stripes, which provides excellent 
camouflage in forests and grasslands. Tigers are powerful predators with muscular bodies and strong 
limbs, capable of bringing down large prey.</p>

<p>Tigers are generally solitary animals, marking large territories that they defend from rivals. They 
hunt primarily at night, relying on stealth and strength to capture prey such as deer, wild boar, and 
buffalo. Each tigerâ€™s stripe pattern is unique, much like a human fingerprint.</p>

<p>They are strong swimmers and often cool off in rivers, ponds, and lakes, which makes them different 
from most other big cats. Despite their strength, tigers are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, 
and declining prey populations.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the tigers at pen T06, inside the big cat territory near the river habitat.</p>
