<h3>AMPHITHEATRE</h3>
<p>The amphitheatre is an ancient architectural design characterized by its circular or oval shape, 
often used for public events, performances, and gatherings. Historically, amphitheatres were built 
by the Romans for various purposes, including gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, and theatrical 
performances.</p>

<p>Modern amphitheatres continue this tradition, hosting a wide range of events such as concerts, 
festivals, and community gatherings. They are designed to provide good acoustics and visibility, 
ensuring that audiences can enjoy performances from various seating positions.</p>

<p>Amphitheatres can be found in many parts of the world, from ancient ruins to modern constructions 
in parks, universities, and entertainment venues. They serve as versatile spaces that bring people 
together for entertainment, education, and cultural experiences.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p></strong>
