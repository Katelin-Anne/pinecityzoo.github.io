<h3>KOALA</h3>
<p>The koala (<i>Phascolarctos cinereus</i>) is a tree-dwelling marsupial native to 
Australia. Recognized by its round, fluffy ears, spoon-shaped nose, and thick grey fur, 
the koala is often mistaken for a bear but is in fact a marsupial, meaning females carry 
their young in a pouch.</p>

<p>Koalas feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which provide them with both food 
and most of their water intake. Because eucalyptus leaves are low in nutrients, koalas 
sleep up to 18â€“20 hours a day to conserve energy. Their strong limbs and sharp claws 
help them climb and grip tree branches securely.</p>

<p>They are solitary animals and spend most of their time in trees, coming down only to 
move between feeding areas. Koalas communicate through a range of vocalizations, 
including deep bellows, especially during mating season.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the koalas at pen A03, inside the eucalyptus grove habitat.</p>
