<h3>LION</h3>
<p>The lion (<i>Panthera leo</i>) is one of the most iconic big cats, often referred to as the 
“king of the jungle.” Lions are native to sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population of 
Asiatic lions surviving in India’s Gir Forest. They are recognized for their muscular bodies, 
powerful roars, and in males, a distinctive mane that varies in color from blond to dark brown.</p>

<p>Lions are social animals, living in groups known as prides, which usually consist of several 
females, their offspring, and a small number of males. Female lions are the primary hunters, 
working cooperatively to bring down prey such as antelope, zebra, and buffalo, while males 
help defend the pride’s territory.</p>

<p>As apex predators, lions play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. They are 
mostly active at night and can often be heard roaring to communicate with other lions and mark 
their territory. Despite their strength, lions face threats from habitat loss and human activity.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the lions at pen L07, near the big cat enclosure.</p>
