<h3>WARTHOG</h3>
<p>The warthog (<i>Phacochoerus africanus</i>) is a wild member of the pig family found in 
savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa. Warthogs are easily 
recognized by their large curved tusks, facial warts, and sparse bristly hair on their 
bodies. Despite their somewhat fierce appearance, they are primarily grazers and 
browsers.</p>

<p>They feed mainly on grasses, roots, berries, and bark, but will also dig for bulbs and 
tubers using their strong snouts and tusks. Warthogs can survive in dry habitats by 
feeding on underground plant parts and often kneel on their front legs while grazing.</p>

<p>Warthogs live in groups called sounders, typically made up of females and their young, 
while males are more solitary. When threatened, they can run quickly, often with their 
tails held upright like a flag. They use abandoned burrows of aardvarks for shelter and 
protection against predators.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the warthogs at pen W02, near the savannah enclosure.</p>
