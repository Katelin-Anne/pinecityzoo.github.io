<h3>GORILLA</h3>
<p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and belong to the genus <i>Gorilla</i>. 
They are primarily found in the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. 
There are two main species: the eastern gorilla (<i>Gorilla beringei</i>) and the 
western gorilla (<i>Gorilla gorilla</i>), each with distinct subspecies. Gorillas 
are known for their muscular build, broad chests, and striking intelligence.</p>

<p>These great apes are herbivorous, feeding mainly on leaves, shoots, fruit, and stems. 
Occasionally, they may consume small insects. Gorillas live in social groups called troops, 
usually led by a dominant silverback male who provides protection and leadership to the group.</p>

<p>Gorillas communicate through a wide range of vocalizations, facial expressions, and gestures. 
They share up to 98% of their DNA with humans, making them one of our closest relatives. Despite 
their strength, gorillas are generally gentle and shy, avoiding conflict whenever possible.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gorillas at pen P05, close to the rainforest enclosure.</p>
