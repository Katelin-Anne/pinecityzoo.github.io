<h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
<p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, belonging to the family Giraffidae. 
They are most easily recognized by their extremely long necks, long legs, and unique 
coat patterns made up of dark patches separated by lighter-colored lines. The most 
common species is the northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) with several subspecies 
scattered across Africa.</p>

<p>Giraffes use their long necks to browse leaves, flowers, and fruits high in trees, 
particularly acacias, which few other herbivores can reach. Their long tongues, 
which can be up to 45 cm, help them strip leaves from branches. Male giraffes often 
engage in “necking,” a behavior where they swing their necks and heads to establish 
dominance. Despite their height, giraffes only have seven neck vertebrae, the same 
number as most mammals.</p>

<p>These animals are herbivorous and are most commonly found in savannahs, grasslands, 
and open woodlands. They are social and usually live in loose groups without strong 
social bonds. Their height gives them an advantage in spotting predators such as lions 
from a distance.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the giraffes at pen G12, near the savannah enclosure.</p>
