<h3>MONKEY</h3>
<p>Monkeys are primates belonging to the infraorder Simiiformes, found in a wide range of habitats 
from tropical rainforests to savannahs and mountainous regions. They are generally divided into 
two groups: Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (found in Central 
and South America). Each group shows unique adaptations suited to their environments.</p>

<p>Monkeys are highly social animals, often living in troops with complex social structures. They 
communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body movements. Many species are known 
for their intelligence, curiosity, and problem-solving abilities. Some monkeys also use tools, 
highlighting their adaptability.</p>

<p>Most monkeys are arboreal, spending much of their time in trees. Their diet is varied, including 
fruits, leaves, seeds, insects, and small animals. Agile climbers, they use their tails (in some 
species, prehensile) and limbs to navigate the forest canopy.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the monkeys at pen M04, in the primate section of the zoo.</p>
