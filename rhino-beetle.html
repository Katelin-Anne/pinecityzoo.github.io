<h3>RHINO BEETLE</h3>
<p>The rhinoceros beetle (subfamily <i>Dynastinae</i>) is one of the largest groups of beetles 
in the world, named for the horn-like structures found on the heads of males. These 
horns are used in battles over territory and mates. Despite their fearsome appearance, 
rhino beetles are harmless to humans.</p>

<p>They are found in tropical and subtropical regions across Africa, Asia, and the Americas. 
Rhino beetles feed mainly on fruit, nectar, and tree sap. The larvae develop underground, 
feeding on decaying wood and plant matter, which helps recycle nutrients in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Rhinoceros beetles are incredibly strong for their size, capable of lifting objects up to 
850 times their own body weight. They are nocturnal and are attracted to lights at night. 
Their shiny armor-like exoskeleton provides protection from predators.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the rhino beetles at exhibit B01, in the insect and small creatures pavilion.</p>
