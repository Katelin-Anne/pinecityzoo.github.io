<h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
<p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope species native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. 
It is well known for its striking appearance, with long, straight horns, distinctive black-and-white 
facial markings, and a sleek, light brown coat. Both males and females carry horns, which can grow 
up to 85 cm in length and are used for defense against predators.</p>

<p>Gemsbok are highly adapted to desert environments, being able to survive with very little water. 
They obtain most of their moisture from the plants they eat, such as succulents, roots, and desert grasses. 
Their efficient cooling system helps them withstand extremely high temperatures during the day.</p>

<p>These antelopes live in herds that typically range from 10 to 40 individuals, although solitary males 
are sometimes found. They are herbivorous and graze on grasses as well as browse on shrubs. Predators of 
the gemsbok include lions, leopards, and hyenas, though their sharp horns make them formidable opponents.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gemsbok at pen G08, near the desert habitat section.</p>
