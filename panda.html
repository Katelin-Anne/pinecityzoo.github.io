<h3>PANDA</h3>
<p>The giant panda (<i>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</i>) is a bear species native to the mountain ranges of 
central China. Known for its distinctive black-and-white fur, the panda is a global symbol of wildlife 
conservation. Pandas are highly adapted to a bamboo diet, which makes up more than 99% of their food 
intake, though they may occasionally eat other plants or small animals.</p>

<p>Pandas are generally solitary animals, with each adult maintaining its own territory. They have a 
specialized wrist bone, often referred to as a "pseudo-thumb," which helps them grip bamboo stalks 
efficiently. Despite being classified as carnivores, their diet and digestive system are more similar 
to that of herbivores.</p>

<p>Giant pandas spend much of their time eating and resting, consuming up to 14 kilograms of bamboo 
daily. They are excellent climbers and can also swim. Conservation efforts in China, including 
breeding programs and habitat protection, have helped increase their population, and they are now 
listed as vulnerable rather than endangered.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the pandas at pen P09, in the bamboo forest enclosure.</p>
